# üßæ ZenLogger

A lightweight, extensible, and high-performance logging framework for Delphi, built with simplicity, traceability, and performance in mind.

ZenLogger introduces a flexible `ILogger` interface and multiple interchangeable logger implementations, suitable for anything from simple CLI tools to complex multithreaded GUI applications.

#### üöÄ Features

- Five log levels: *Error*, *Warning*, *Info*, *Debug*, *Trace*
- Pluggable logger kinds: *Null*, *Standard*, *Console*, *Async*, *ThreadSafe*, *Mock*
- File rotation with retention policy
- Trace logger with profiling support
- Sync and async implementations
- Thread-safe with minimal file locking
- Centralized initialization via `LogManager`


## üîß Usage Overview

```pascal
uses ZenLogger;

begin
  InitializeLogger(LOG_KIND_ASYNC, LL_INFO);
  Log.Info('Application started.');
end;
```
> [!NOTE]
> `InitializeLogger` is optional, used to update the *Default Log [Configuration](#%EF%B8%8F-configuration)*.

Each log level has an overload with `Format` support:

```pascal
Log.Warning('Missing configuration for %s', [ConfigName]);
```


## üìà Log Levels

| Level     | Purpose                                                               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Error*   | Indicates a serious problem that has caused a failure in part of the application (e.g. exceptions or critical failures)  |
| *Warning* | Highlights a potential issue or unexpected behavior that isn't immediately harmful but may lead to problems              |
| *Info*    | Provides general operational messages that track the application‚Äôs progress  |
| *Debug*   | Gives detailed diagnostic information useful for debugging (e.g. internal state changes, variable values) |
| *Trace*   | The most detailed level, showing step-by-step execution or fine-grained application flow, typically used for in-depth troubleshooting |



## üß± Logger Kinds

| Logger Kind   | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Null*        | Ignores all messages.                                                       |
| *Standard*    | Logs directly to file (sync). Base class for file-based logging.            |
| *Console*     | Logs to console or `OutputDebugString` depending on app type.               |
| *Async*       | Queues messages and writes in background using `TTask`.                     |
| *ThreadSafe*  | Adds mutex locking and thread ID to logs. Useful for concurrency debugging. |
| *Mock*        | Used for unit testing where the a log file is not needed. Instead, the mock logger fires events  |


#### üö´ Null Logger

The `Null Logger` is an easy way to disable all logs from the application. 


#### üìÇ `Standard` File Logging

`TFileLogger` is synchronous, thread-safe and reliable logging to file.

- File name: `{LogName}_yyyy-mm-dd.log`
- Auto-deletes files older than `DaysKeep`
- Safe for general use and crash diagnostics

`TFileLogger` is the base class for all file loggers.

#### üñ• Console Logger

For CLI *(command-line interface)* programs that rely on console output, `TConsoleLogger` detects if the standard console output is available and sends logs directly to the terminal in real-time.
Otherwise, it uses `OutputDebugString` API function sending logs to a *debugger*.


#### ‚ö° `TAsyncLogger`

- Uses a thread-safe queue + background `TTask` to write logs
- Significantly faster than standard logger
- Log file written in batches

#### üßµ `TThreadSafeLogger`

- Adds `TH-<ThreadID>` to each log entry
- Enforces exclusive file access using a mutex
- Better visibility when diagnosing thread-related issues

#### üß™ Mock Logger

`TMockLogger` is used for unit testing, allowing validation of log calls without actual output. 

Use `TMockLogger.RegisterMockHandler` to register event handlers before hand.

Instead or writing logs, it triggers those registered events to validate what it should have been sent to the log.


#### üß≠ Trace Logger & Profiling

`ITraceLogger` wraps a method or scope to log execution entry, exit, and duration.

```pascal
procedure TSortThread.ArraySwap(I, J: Integer);
begin
  var Log := GetTraceLogger(ClassName, 'ArraySwap', fLogger).Trace;
  Log.Debug('Swapping %d, %d', [I, J]);
  // Do the swap...
end;
```

When `LogLevel = LL_TRACE`, adds:

- Enter/Exit "Trace" log lines
- Elapsed time
- Profiling stats

```
20:15:30.350 TRACE..... >>> TQuickSort.ArraySwap  
20:15:30.350 DEBUG..... TQuickSort.ArraySwap: Swapping 735, 998  
20:15:30.350 TRACE..... <<< TQuickSort.ArraySwap (2 ms)  
20:15:30.350 TRACE..... <<< TQuickSort.Execute (31.279 sec)  
```

üî¨ Tip: Use `.Trace` to track performance even when `LogLevel` is lower.
```
Function: TQuickSort.Execute
  Exec Count: 1
  Total Time: 31.279 s
Function: TQuickSort.ArraySwap
  Exec Count: 2668
  Total Time: 9.095 s
    Max Time: 17 ms
    Min Time: 3 ms
    Avg Time: 3 ms
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

Global logger is initialized on first use, or via:

```
procedure InitializeLogger(LogKind, LogLevel, LogName, LogPath, DaysKeep);
```

All parameters are optional. With no params, it's used to explicitly initialize the global logger using the default configuration:

| Configuration Variable   | Default Value  | Description                                                  |
|--------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Default_LogKind          | 1 = *Standard* | The basic file logger. Thread safe, synchronous logging.     |
| Default_LogLevel         | 3 = *Info*     | see [Log Levels](#-log-levels).                              |
| Default_LogName          | '' <empty>     | if empty - use the file name from `ModuleName` (app|library) |
| Default_LogPath          | '' <empty>     | if empty - use the path as above.                            |
| Default_DaysKeep         | 30             | Keep for a month, just in case there are delays in reporting issues. |

Set these before logging begins, or call `ReleaseLogger` to force re-initialization from updated defaults.
